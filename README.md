# Netflix-Inspired Simulations for Browsing Efficiency (MSDS 629 - Experiments in Data Science, Course Project)

## Summary:

The goal of this project is to find an optimal set of conditions to minimize a Netflix userâ€™s browsing time. We used fundamentals of A/B testing such as factorial design, F-tests, and randomized searching to analyze browsing time data collected through simulations. We found that the optimal conditions were: Tile Size = 0.2 (default), Match Score = 77%, Preview Length = 75 seconds, and Preview Type = Teaser/Trailer (TT) with a 95% confidence interval of browsing time being about 9.78 to 10.14 minutes.
